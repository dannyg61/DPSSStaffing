        <p>The attached DPSS 467, Transfer Request, has been processed and is being forwarded to you for consideration. Please remember there must be a vacant position and approval to fill that position before any transfers take place.</p>
        <p>This request will remain active until &amp;&amp;ExpirationDate, unless honored, withdrawn, denied, or there is a change in classification, at which point, the transfer will be closed.</p>
		<p>Submitting a DPSS 467 to request a lateral transfer does not guarantee an interview or reassignment opportunity.
